Cluedo
======

Implementation of the popular board game Cluedo, for a software engineering assignment at Victoria University.

This was the second part of an assignment we had during my second year software engineering paper Swen222.
The first part was the same implementation but with no GUI. This is the final product with GUI.
Sivan Fesherman worked on this project with me.
